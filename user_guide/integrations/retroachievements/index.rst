`RetroAchievements <https://retroachievements.org/>`__ is a service that introduces achievements on classic systems, such as the SNES, Genesis, PlayStation, and many others. It also tracks your progression, statistics, and allows you to compete with other players.

RetroHub can fetch your personal achievement information and progression, providing it for supported themes.
