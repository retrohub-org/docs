Tutorial
========

This tutorial will guide you on the creation of a simple theme, from scratch.

RetroHub requires you to code every aspect of your theme. This includes how you present information, and interact with it. Therefore, it requires much more effort to create even a simple theme, when compared to other frontends where most of your thmee is interpreted text from XML/JSON files.

The advantage, however, is that there's no restrictions to what your theme can be. This tutorial will guide you on creating a very simple UI layout, but you'll soon notice how you can control every aspect of how your theme looks and behaves.

Before starting
---------------

RetroHub runs using the Godot Engine. Therefore, a theme is essentially a Godot project, or scene. It's expected that you're familiar with the engine before proceeding with this tutorial. While it will guide you step-by-step, it won't explain any core concept important from Godot.

If you never coded in Godot before, we suggest you take some time learning it before starting with theme development. A few good resources to start with:

- `Your first 2D game <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html>`_: Step-by-step tutorial on how to create 2D content
- `Your first 3D game <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html>`_: Step-by-step tutorial on how to create 3D content, if you wish to create 3D themes.
- `Using signals <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html>`_: Lesson which teaches signals, a core concept of Godot which RetroHub depends on heavily.
